# RL Assignment 4

**Name:** Vijay Tadikamalla
**Roll. no:** CS17BTECH11040

**Assignment 4:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vijayphoenix/IITH-BTECH-Courses/tree/master/6th-Sem/RL/RL%20assignment%204)

Due to limited internet connectivity, I could not download the required python packages (like tensorflow, gym),
my assignment solutions and ipynb notebooks (with cell output) on my local computer.

So, I have given the link to the assignments on colab as well as uploaded them on GitHub (using colab).

On GitHub, each question has ipynb notebooks, outputs and a readme with the link to the same ipynb notebook 
on colab (sometimes GitHub does not render the ipynb notebooks properly).

I am extremely sorry for this inconvenience.
